Description: US VAERS vaccine data for 01/01/2018 - 06/14/2018. If you want to
    explore the full VAERS data for 1990 - Present (data, symptoms, and
    vaccines), then check out the 'vaers' package from the URL below. The URL
    and BugReports below correspond to the 'vaers' package, of which 'vaersvax'
    is a small subset (2018 only). 'vaers' is not hosted on CRAN due to the
    large size of the data set. To install the Suggested 'vaers' and 'vaersND'
    packages, use the following R code:
    'devtools::install_git("<https://gitlab.com/iembry/vaers.git>",
    build_vignettes = TRUE)' and
    'devtools::install_git("<https://gitlab.com/iembry/vaersND.git>",
    build_vignettes = TRUE)'. "The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)
    is a national early warning system to detect possible safety problems in
    U.S.-licensed vaccines. VAERS is co-managed by the Centers for Disease Control
    and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)." For
    more information about the data, visit <https://vaers.hhs.gov/>. For
